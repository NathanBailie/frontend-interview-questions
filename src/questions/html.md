HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web.

DOCTYPE (Document Type Declaration) is an instruction at the beginning of an HTML document that tells the browser which version of HTML to use for rendering the page

<summary><h3 style="display: inline;">What are the ways to link a JavaScript file to an HTML document?</h3></summary>
<br />

There are two main ways to include JavaScript in an HTML document:

1. **External JavaScript**

   ```html
   <!-- Synchronous loading (at the end of body) -->
   <body>
   	<!-- content -->
   	<script src="script.js"></script>
   </body>

   <!-- Asynchronous loading (in head) -->
   <head>
   	<script src="script.js" defer></script>
   	<!-- Executes after HTML is parsed, doesn't block HTML parsing -->
   	<script src="script.js" async></script>
   	<!-- Executes immediately when downloaded, doesn't block HTML parsing, may break execution order -->
   </head>
   ```

   Key points:

   - Most maintainable approach
   - Can be cached by browsers
   - Can control loading behavior with `defer` and `async` attributes
   - One file can be reused across multiple pages

2. **Inline JavaScript**

   ```html
   <script>
   	function sayHello() {
   		alert('Hello!');
   	}
   </script>
   ```

   or directly in HTML elements:

   ```html
   <button onclick="sayHello()">Click me</button>
   ```

   - Code is embedded directly in HTML
   - Cannot be cached
   - Mixes behavior with content
   - Useful for small, page-specific scripts
