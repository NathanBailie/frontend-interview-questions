<br />

- Only language supported by all browsers without plugins
- Dynamic content updates without page reloads
- Async capabilities with AJAX, Fetch API and Promises
- Flexible for both simple animations and complex web apps
- Rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks
- Direct DOM manipulation and styling

<summary><h3 style="display: inline;">What are the data types in JavaScript?</h3></summary>
<br />

JavaScript has 8 data types: 7 primitive types and 1 object type.

**Primitive types (non-object):**

1. **Number** ‚Äì for all numbers (integers and floats)
2. **String** ‚Äì sequences of characters
3. **Boolean** ‚Äì `true` or `false`
4. **Null** ‚Äì special value representing "nothing" or "empty"
5. **Undefined** ‚Äì variable declared but not assigned
6. **Symbol** ‚Äì unique and immutable value, mostly for object keys
7. **BigInt** ‚Äì for large integers beyond `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`

**Object type:**

8. **Object** ‚Äì includes arrays, functions, dates, regexes, maps, sets, and custom objects.

<summary><h3 style="display: inline;">What is the difference between null and undefined?</h3></summary>
<br />

Both **null** and **undefined** represent "nothing" or absence of value, but they are used differently:

- **undefined** is automatically assigned by JavaScript to variables that are declared but not initialized
- **null** is a data type that programmer explicitly assigns to indicate an intentional absence of value
